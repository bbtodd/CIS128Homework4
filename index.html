        <h2>Progressive web apps</h2>
          <p>
            1. A progressive web app (PWA) is an app that's built using web platform technologies, but that provides a user experience like that of a platform-specific app.
          </p>
          <p>
            PWAs typically look like platform-specific apps － they are usually displayed without the browser UI around them － but they are, as a matter of technology, still websites. This means they need a browser engine, like the ones in Chrome or Firefox, to manage and run them. With a platform-specific app, the platform OS manages the app, providing the environment in which it runs. With a PWA, a browser engine performs this background role, just like it does for normal websites.          
          </p>

          <p>Progressive web apps combine the best features of traditional websites and platform-specific apps.</p>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold">PWAs have the benefits of websites, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PWAs are developed using standard web platform technologies, so they can run on multiple operating systems and device classes from a single codebase.</li>
            <li>PWAs can be accessed directly from the web.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="font-weight:bold">PWAs also have many of the benefits of platform-specific apps, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The PWA can be installed from platform's app store or installed directly from the web.</li>
            <li>The PWA can be installed like a platform-specific app, and can customize the install process.</li>
            <li>Once installed, the PWA gets an app icon on the device, alongside platform-specific apps.</li>
            <li>Once installed, the PWA can be launched as a standalone app, rather than a website in a browser.</li>
            <li>PWAs can work while the device does not have network connectivity.</li>
            <li>Update content in the background.</li>
            <li>Respond to push messages from the server.</li>
            <li>Display notifications using the OS notifications system.</li>
            <li>PWAs can use the whole screen, rather than running in the browser UI.</li>
            <li>PWAs can be integrated into the device, registering as share targets and sources, and accessing device features.</li>
            <li>PWAs can be distributed in app stores, as well as openly via the web.</li>
          </ul>
